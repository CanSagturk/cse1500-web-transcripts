*At times we use ‚òùÔ∏è and üëá to make it clear whether an explanation belongs to the code snippet above or below the text. The :bangbang: sign is added to code examples you should run yourself. When you see a DEBUG box, we offer advice on how to debug your code  - these hints are solely to help you with your programming project and not exam material. The same goes for OPTIONAL content: we provide a bit of extra information in those boxes which is not exam material.*
