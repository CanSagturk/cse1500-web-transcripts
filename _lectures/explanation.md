*At times we use ☝️ and 👇 to make it clear whether an explanation refers to the code snippet above or below the text. The :bangbang: sign is added to code examples you should run yourself. When you come across a `DEBUG` box, we offer advice on how to debug your code&mdash;this may help you with your assignments. Neither `DEBUG` nor `OPTIONAL` content are exam material.*
